### quick structure of the dataframe
str(nycflights)

### histogram
ggplot(data = nycflights, aes(x = dep_delay)) +
  geom_histogram()

### bin width
***size of bars***
ggplot(data = nycflights, aes(x = dep_delay)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 15)
ggplot(data = nycflights, aes(x = dep_delay)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 150)

### new variable name
***filtering destination to RDU***
rdu_flights <- nycflights %>%
  filter(dest == "RDU")

***histogram of depature delays to RDU***
ggplot(data = rdu_flights, aes(x = dep_delay)) +
  geom_histogram()

### logical operators
- `==` means "equal to"
- `!=` means "not equal to"
- `>` or `<` means "greater than" or "less than"
- `>=` or `<=` means "greater than or equal to" or "less than or equal to"
</div>

### summary statistics for variables

rdu_flights %>%
  summarise(mean_dd = mean(dep_delay), sd_dd = sd(dep_delay), n = n())
